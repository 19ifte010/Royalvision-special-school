            <p class="about-para">Royalvision is an organization founded in 2007 in Madurai with the chief objective of spreading light and happiness in the life of those who are affected with one or the other physical disabilities. Needed help is extended to them on the basis of <b>‘COMPANIONSHIP’</b> but certainly not on the basis of COMPASSION. They are trained day in and day out to <b>‘Strive, seek and achieve and not to Yield’</b>. On the unshakeable strong base of selfless, tireless and ceaseless service to society in general and the otherwise abled in particular stands the edifice of this charitable trust established by M.ULAGASANDRON, M.A., B.L., and registered under the Indian Trust Act 1882 with its registered office and Headquarters in Madurai. The trust leaves no stone unturned to achieve its goal of uplifting the status and standard of life of the otherwise abled by making them educationally enlightened, economically independent and socially respected the trust makes them holistic human beings with mental ability, intellectual sharpness and spiritual attitude.</p>
